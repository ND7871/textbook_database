            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>The idea around this software is to create a website that UNT students can access to determine if they need to purchase, sell, or trade textbooks. The website will offer students a simple way to find out what their required textbooks are, if they are required, and what the most affordable way is to get them. 

                This simplifies the process of learning textbook requirements, where users can also specify what professors require for each class since certain professors tend to have different requirements.
